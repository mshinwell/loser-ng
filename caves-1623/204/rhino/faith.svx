; Steps to making a 204 survey on this computer
;(you'll need to make adjustments if you want to enter a surface survey
; or a survey of another cave, as they don't belong in this directory).
;
;1. Go caving, find cave, survey it ,etc...
;
;2. To use this template, first save it with your own file name.
; You will then be able to edit and save it.
; Use *export to tell survex ehich points will link to other surveys.
;
;3. Edit 204.svx to link your new survey to the old one.
; i.e. use something like *equate oldsurvey.point23 newsurvey.point1
; This line will need to be added near the bottom of the file, (see
; the entries already there for examples.)
;
;4. When you have made and saved your file, use CVS to add and commit it
; (and the changes you made to 204.svx. Get a grown up to help you with 
; this, or ask Mark or Earl.)
;
;5. Process all.svx and 204.svx. There's a handy icon on the desktop for this.
;
;6. View your survey with Aven. There's an icon on the desktop to do this.
;
;7. When your feeling nerdy enough, use extend and printps and print to get 
; elevations to draw up
