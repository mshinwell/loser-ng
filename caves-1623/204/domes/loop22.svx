; (why? because someone said we couldn't have files with
; names long enough to be meaningful - so note the irony of the six character
; name...) Anyway, this is a survey from the bolt at the head of a pitch known
; to Brian as 'Pink Elephant' to the head of a ~30m pitch in White Elephant.
; It connects Brian's 'Pleasuredome' area with the 'White Elephant' series.
