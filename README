Dataset conventions

- Use Unix line endings (i.e. \n not \r\n).

- Use UTF-8 character encoding.

- Cave numbers are written without any leading zeros at all (in filenames,
  survey names, or anything else!).

- Entrances have station names such as p204b.  In the event of the tag
  location being different from the entrance location, the tag point
  should be named with a "t" instead, e.g. t204b.

- No full stop (.) characters in station names.

- All filenames to be in lower case.

- No filenames starting with "-" or "!".

- Caves with a provisional number consisting of a year and a serial number
  should be hyphenated, thus 2002-04 not 2002_04 or any of the various other
  variants.
