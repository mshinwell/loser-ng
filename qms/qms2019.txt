  Opposite side of survey stationone on the other side of Ulysses sits a very obvious railway sized phreatic passage. To get through to this passage will require a traverse and bolt climb up into it. Very large draft and very promising as slapys to the end of Ulysses chamber sits at23.163, whilst splay into the railway passage is 48.85 (slay name:1->1u), so passage estmated to be 26 metres in width.

  To one side of the chamber is a tight rift, that has been reffered to as 'too-tight'. This leads to a large, echo'y space within sight. This is probably accessed via following the water below, but if the water goes elsewhere this is very worth checking out. A determined, brave, and thin individual could likely find a way through: although even this person may want a backup of some sort.
