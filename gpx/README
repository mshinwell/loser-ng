The folders for each year are for general gpx files from recorded tracks, which will be included as surface legs in all.svx.
gpx_publish is for creating exportable files to personal gps devices or smart phones.


To add a new GPS tracklog or waypoint file:

0. Read the Handbook on this http://expo.survex.com/handbook/essentials.html
which may be more up to date than this README

1. Download the .gpx file(s) from your GPS.  (On modern Garmin GPSes this is done
by connecting the GPS using a USB cable and then copying the relevant files
from the "GPX" directory inside the "Garmin" directory on the USB disk.)

2. Create a new directory for the year if required (following the "2018"
example) in the "gpx" subdirectory of the dataset.  Put the .gpx file(s) in the
year directory.  They need to be renamed so as to follow our naming convention
(see the "2018" directory).  No formal distinction needs to be made between
files containing tracklogs and files containing waypoints (or a mix of the
two).

3. Update (or create if currently absent) the additional_info.svx file in
the year directory following the 2018 example.  This is the place to rename
stations to follow normal conventions and to mark waypoints as entrances,
etc.  The file must be present even if empty.

4. Open a terminal in this directory and run the make_svx.sh script.  This
requires the gpx2survex program (https://github.com/mshinwell/gps2survex;
installation instructions to follow).

5. Run "cavern all.svx" at the toplevel then "aven all.3d".  Check that the
tracks appear as expected when fixed points / surface surveys are enabled.

6. Commit everything to hg and push.
