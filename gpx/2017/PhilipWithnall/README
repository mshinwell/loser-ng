Here are my GPX logs from prospecting on Expo this year. These are straight off my phone, unprocessed, and hence only useful as a general guide to where I ended up prospecting, and the leads I was looking at.

favourites.gpx contains waypoints for various promising-looking holes. There are some rough notes in the name of each waypoint. Some of the waypoints are existing tagged caves, such as Balcony, or caves which were tagged this year (2017-NR-01, for example). These correspond to some of the photos in expofiles/photos/2017/PhilipWithnall/.

The other two GPX files contain tracks of where I walked on two days of prospecting. They can be overlayed onto a map to see the area covered. Accuracy is not great, since the tracks were recorded with a phone GPS. The software used was OsmAnd+ (see the surface survex file for cave 2017-PW-01 for full technical details of the software).

The idea is that I covered a roughly rectangular area fairly thoroughly, so most of the leads within that area should have been spotted by me, unless I went temporarily blind. So for the purposes of planning future prospecting, just look outside the bounding box of these tracks.
