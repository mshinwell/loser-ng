This file is a place to put handy info on maintaining the dataset.

We could have a set of actual scripts, but until there is more than
one, let's try note form.

See HTML troggle & cave survey data documentation at

Line-endings
------------

The dataset is kept with unix linefeed style. DOS (and mac) files get
checked-in regularly, and from time to time someone uses an editor so
dim that that it makes files mixed-lineend.

This handy command will unixfy all the DOS-style .svx files:

find . -not -type d -name "*.svx" -exec file "{}" ";" | grep CRLF |
awk '{print $1}' | sed -e 's/:$//' | xargs fromdos -v

(it needs 'tofrodos' package installed. 'unix2dos' can be used instead).

Cave names
------------

Cave names do not have leading zeros
They are stored by number/ID in the dataset, not by name.
create them like this:

File names
-------------

No spaces in filenames. use underscores. 
Don't use capitals. If you do, make _sure_ that they are used exactly the same in include statements.
Otherwise it's easy to make datasets that work on Windows, but not Mac/Unix

Don't create two files spelt the same except for capitalisation. That makes a dataset that will overwrite itself on Windows.
